//! Allows the caller to wait for an amount of time, measured either in computer uptime or in-game
//! real time.
//!
//! Sleep functions can be distinguished based on which measurement of time they use. In this axis,
//! two measurements are available: uptime and world time. Uptime measures the time the computer
//! has been in a loaded chunk since it was last booted; it passes only while the game is running
//! (i.e. not paused or shut down) and the computer is in a loaded chunk. World time, in contrast,
//! still only passes while the game is running (i.e. not paused or shut down), but it still passes
//! even if the chunk containing the computer is unloaded; world time is therefore synchronized to
//! the world’s day/night cycle.
//!
//! Sleep functions can also be distinguished based on whether they accept a duration (a time
//! period relative to the moment when they are called) or a deadline (a point in time at which the
//! sleep will end).
//!
//! Sleeping based on uptime is more efficient than sleeping based on world time. Therefore, if
//! either is acceptable for your application, prefer uptime.
