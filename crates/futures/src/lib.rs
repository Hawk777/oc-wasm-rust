//! This crate provides a collection of async futures for making method calls and sleeping.
//!
//! # Features
//! The `proper-waker` feature, which is enabled by default, makes the sleep futures fully
//! compliant with the [`Future`](core::future::Future) specification. Disabling the feature uses
//! an alternative implementation which only keeps track of the shortest deadline (rather than the
//! deadlines of all in-progress sleeps); this reduces code size, but only works if your choice of
//! executor polls all tasks on every wakeup (as certain simple executors do) rather than keeping a
//! proper ready-queue and requiring each task to be woken by its own [`Waker`](core::task::Waker).
