pub enum Error {
	/// The call was addressed to a component that does not exist, is not accessible, or is of the
	/// wrong type.
	///
	/// The underlying syscall error is encapsulated.
	BadComponent(oc_wasm_safe::error::Error),

	/// An unsupported screen resolution, viewport size, or screen coordinate was requested.
	BadCoordinate,

	/// An unsupported colour depth was requested.
	BadDepth,

	/// The filename passed to a function is structurally invalid to be a filename.
	BadFilename,

	/// The character to use to fill the screen lies outside the basic multilingual plane and
	/// therefore cannot be used for filling.
	BadFillCharacter,

	/// An index number is outside the range of slots for an inventory or tanks for a
	/// fluid-containing block.
	///
	/// In the case of item inventories, this is only returned if the block is in fact an
	/// inventory; [`NoInventory`](Self::NoInventory) is returned for non-inventories. In the case
	/// of fluid containers, this is also returned if the block is not a fluid container at all (it
	/// is treated as a fluid container with zero tanks), but not if the block is in an unloaded
	/// chunk.
	BadInventorySlot,

	/// An item is not usable for the requested purpose.
	///
	/// For example, an item that does not hold fluid cannot have its fluid level or capacity
	/// queried.
	BadItem,

	/// A set-colour request tried to set a colour by palette index, and the palette index was
	/// unacceptable. This could be because the palette index was outside the range of the palette
	/// for the current bit depth, or it could be because the current bit depth does not support a
	/// palette at all.
	BadPaletteIndex,

	/// The address specified when binding a GPU does not exist, is inaccessible, or is not a
	/// screen; or, a GPU operation which requires a screen was executed when the GPU is unbound or
	/// the screen to which it was bound has been disconnected.
	BadScreen,

	/// The robot cannot move because there is something in the way.
	Blocked(super::robot::BlockContent),

	/// The checksum passed when trying to make an EEPROM read-only does not match the checksum of
	/// the contents of the EEPROM.
	ChecksumMismatch,

	/// The data (e.g. to write to a file or EEPROM or send over a communication interface) is too
	/// large.
	DataTooLarge,

	/// The named file or directory does not exist.
	FileNotFound,

	/// The robot tried to move to a position that is too far away from support (and does not have
	/// a suitable hover upgrade to allow such movement), tried to move into an unloaded chunk, or
	/// the destination is otherwise unsuitable for a reason other than there being something in
	/// the way.
	ImpossibleMove,

	/// An attempt was made to move an item or fluid into an inventory slot or tank, but it could
	/// not be inserted because the slot or tank is full, or the existing contents are not
	/// compatible with the new addition.
	InventoryFull,

	/// A seek in a file would place the file pointer at a negative position.
	NegativeSeek,

	/// There is no item in an inventory slot when one is required.
	NoItem,

	/// There is no inventory in the specified location. This includes if the inventory is in an
	/// unloaded chunk.
	///
	/// This is also returned when attempting to access a fluid tank in an unloaded chunk, but not
	/// when attempting to access a fluid tank in a block that does not contain any tanks; in the
	/// latter case, [`BadInventorySlot`](Self::BadInventorySlot) is used instead.
	NoInventory,

	/// The computer does not have enough energy to perform the operation.
	NotEnoughEnergy,

	/// The storage (e.g. EEPROM or filesystem) cannot be written to because it is read-only.
	StorageReadOnly,

	/// There are too many open descriptors.
	TooManyDescriptors,

	/// There are too many listening network ports.
	TooManyOpenPorts,

	/// There are too many parts in a packet.
	TooManyParts,

	/// The operation is not supported for this component.
	///
	/// For example:
	/// * An attempt was made to set a filesystemâ€™s label, but this particular filesystem does not
	///   support labels.
	/// * An attempt was made to access item stack information in an inventory, but detailed item
	///   information access is disabled in the configuration file.
	Unsupported,

	/// The operation failed but no more detailed information is available at the type level. The
	/// individual method may document more specific reasons for this error to appear.
	Failed,
